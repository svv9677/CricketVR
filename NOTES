Logic Flow
==========
On Device - UI Toggle/Slider - onXXX(t/val) - set member var - updateXXX(false) - if diff, update & set player prefs
In Editor - Inspector set member var 	- Main.Update() - updateXXX(true) - as above PLUS update UI / save prefs
From code - 		  set member var 	- Main.Update() - updateXXX(true) - as above PLUS update UI / save prefs
